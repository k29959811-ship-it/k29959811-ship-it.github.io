 # ☁️ Mission: Senior Cloud Security Architect
### "From Grade 7 to the Cloud" | Philippines 🇵🇭

This repository hosts my **Digital Dream Board**—a roadmap detailing my journey from a student to a high-level Cloud Architect in BGC/Makati. It tracks my technical growth, career milestones, and life goals.

Built with a clear vision, this project categorizes my path into four pillars:

*   **📚 Education:** Transitioning from ICT/STEM to a BS in Computer Science at **UP Tacloban**.
*   **💼 Career:** A calculated path from Associate to Senior Architect (Target: J.P. Morgan).
*   **🏡 Lifestyle:** Visualizing the rewards of the grind (Modern Estate & The Garage).
*   **💰 Financials:** A commitment to family and smart investing (MP2 & Tech Stocks).
