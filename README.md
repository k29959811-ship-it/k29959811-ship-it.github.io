A personal portfolio website showcasing my journey from Grade 7 toward becoming a Cloud Architect. Built with HTML and CSS 
README.md # My Personal Portfolio Website
Welcome! This is my first step toward becoming a **Cloud Architect**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This is a Level 1 project where I built a personal website from scratch. The goal was to learn how to structure data (HTML) and style it (CSS) before moving on to cloud-based automation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the website structure.
* **CSS3:** For the layout and design.
* **GitHub Pages:** For hosting and deployment.

## ☁️ Cloud Path Connection
Even though this is a basic site, hosting it on GitHub Pages is my first experience with **web hosting** and **deployment**, which are core skills for any Cloud Architect.
